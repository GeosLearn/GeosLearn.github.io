			<h2>Learning materials for Geosciences</h2>
		</header>
		<p><strong>GeosLearn</strong> is a teaching related website where you will find lectures & labs materials
			for some of the UoS I am involved in.</p>

						<h2>Ocean data query</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Ocean Data portals are routinely used by marine scientists to better understand the complexity of the Ocean and its interactions with
						Climate and Life. Understanding how these data are stored and how to quickly extract particular informations from them is what you
						will learn in this module!

						<h2>Mapping Resources</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Mapping global distribution of mineral & oil resources and reserves are essential skills for geoscientists. Australia has an abundant and diverse range of energy resources.
						Using open-source libraries, you will learn how to map some of Australian offshore resources with Jupyter notebooks.</p>

						<h2>Coastal evolution</h2>
					</header>
					<p>This module focuses on medium to long-term coastal evolution. You will gain some understanding on how to set up and use numerical models for coastal projects.
						In particular, you will simulate the impact of storms on 2D beach profiles, explore the sensitivities of crenulated bay to wave condition and
						build models of longshore transport.</p>

						<h2>Basin formation</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Sedimentary basins are regions where considerable thicknesses of sediments have accumulated. Sedimentary basins are widespread both onshore and offshore.
						In this module we will present some natural examples of basin formation and how they form.</p>

						<h2>Deltaic systems</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Deltaic depositional facies result from interacting dynamics processes (wave energy, tidal regime, currents, climate, tectonic), which
						modify and disperse fluvial clastic deposits. The complexity of environmental settings under which deltas exist results in a variety of vertical
						sequences that can form within the delta facies. </p>

						<h2>Tectonic geomorphology</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Tectonic geomorphology is the study of the interplay between tectonic and surface processes that shape the landscape in regions of active
						deformation and at time scales ranging from days to millions of years. Using <a href="https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands/wiki">Badlands</a>,
						we will make quantitative assessment of the impact of these tectonic forces on landscape and drainage evolution.</p>

					<h3>School</h3>
					<p>The resources available here are primary intended for undergrads enrolled in a Senior Unit in Geology & Geophysics and/or Marine Science within
						our <a href="http://www.geosci.usyd.edu.au/index.shtml">School</a>
						here at <strong><a href="http://sydney.edu.au/science/index.shtml">The University of Sydney</a></strong>.</p>

					<h3>Lectures</h3>
					<p>My teaching focuses on various aspects of Surface and Marine processes modelling.
						I use <strong><a href="http://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js">Reveal.js</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></strong> to
						create my presentations since my research projects are already up there.</p>

					<h3>Labs</h3>
					<p>I have been using Jupyter Notebook for both Research & Teaching since 2014 and the labs materials are mostly based on this environment.
						<strong><a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tryjupyter.html#try-in-your-browser-no-installation-needed" target="_blank">Try using Jupyter Notebook</a></strong>,
						and look at the Jupyter website for more details...</p>
