This workshop aims to introduce those interested in landscape evolution and source to sink problems to a new open-source code: Badlands. Note that you do not have to be a seasoned modeller to participate. Geomorphologists, tectonicists and sedimentologists interested in testing conceptual models based on field observations are welcome!

Background on Badlands:
Basin and Landscape Dynamics (Badlands) is a landscape evolution model, built to simulate topography development at various space and time scales. The model is capable of simulating hillslope processes, fluvial incision ('modified' Stream Power Law, Transport Capacity Law both for sediment erosion/transport/deposition), spatially and temporally varying geodynamic (horizontal + vertical displacements) and climatic forces which can be used to simulate changes in base level, as well as effects of climate changes or sea-level fluctuations. In addition the model can solve elastic plate flexure problems.

Over the last year, within the ARC Basin Genesis Hub, I have started the development of a new numerical framework to better quantify the fundamental feedbacks between mantle flow, geodynamics, landscape dynamics and associated sediment transport at continental scale. The approach relies on Badlands (a finite volume code which simulated geomorphological evolution and stratigraphic records under various climatic and tectonic forcing).  Here I present how this new framework can be used to quantify the impact of dynamic topography on Australian landscape evolution over the  last 150 Ma.
