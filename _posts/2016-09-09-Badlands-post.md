Global distribution of mineral & oil resources and reserves are essential to understand not only the economic wealth of specific countries but also some of the major conflicts taking place in different regions of the World.
Australia has an abundant and diverse range of energy resources. It has very large coal resources that underpin exports and low-cost domestic electricity production, more than one third of the world's known uranium resources, and substantial conventional gas and coal seam gas resources.

**Mapping these resources are essential skills for geoscientists. Using open-source libraries, you will learn how to map some of Australian offshore resources with Jupyter notebooks.**
