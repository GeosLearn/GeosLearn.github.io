Tectonic geomorphology is the study of the _interplay between tectonic and surface processes_ that shape the landscape in regions of active deformation and at time scales ranging from days to millions of years. Using [**Badlands**](https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands/wiki), we will make a __quantitative assessment__ of the impact of these __tectonic__ forces on landscape and drainage evolution. We will also look at how __climate__, and in particular the spatial pattern of precipitation, is affecting the topographic and tectonic evolution of mountain belts through erosion.
