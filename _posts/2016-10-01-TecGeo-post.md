Tectonic geomorphology is the study of the _interplay between tectonic and surface processes_ that shape the landscape in regions of active deformation and at time scales ranging from days to millions of years. Using **[Badlands](https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands/wiki)**, we will make a __quantitative assessment__ of the impact of these __tectonic__ forces on landscape and drainage evolution. We will also look at how __climate__, and in particular the spatial pattern of precipitation, is affecting the topographic and tectonic evolution of mountain belts through erosion.

  <p><strong>Tectonic processes</strong> govern the dynamic nature of Earth’s crust and shape the global distribution of continents, ocean basins, and landforms.  Setting the template on which <strong>climate</strong> and <strong>erosion</strong> interact, tectonics elevates rocks above sea level where weathering prepares the ground for wind, rain, and rivers to erode and sculpt landscapes. <br/>
  It is no coincidence that many of our planet’s major surface features coincide with the boundaries of tectonic plates, where uplift, deformation, and erosion are focused. The imprint of tectonics on geomorphology is apparent not only in the size, extent, and location of mountain ranges, but in the localized steepness of river profiles, the character of mountain slopes, and in the form of river networks that flow along regional joint patterns or are offset across faults.</p>

  <strong>Geomorphological units & hillslope processes</strong>


  <p>The fluvial dissection of the landscape consists of valleys and their included channel ways organized into a system of connection known as a drainage network. Drainage networks display many types of quantitative regularity that are useful in analyzing both the fluvial systems and the terrains that they dissect (Howard, 1967). Drainage basins are the principal hydrologic unit considered in fluvial geomorphology. A drainage basin is the source for water and sediment that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms. <br/>
  In the first part of the lecture we will look at the different components of a drainage basin. Then we will describe the dominant types of processes present on hillslopes where both gravity and running water are active. We will discuss the physical principles underlying mass movements and slope stability.</p>

  <strong>Fundamentals of landscape evolution modelling</strong>

    <p>
    In this module we will focus on the main equations developed in landscape evolution models (LEMs). These models are quantitative tools used to simulate Earth surface processes and the evolution of the land surface. LEMs can be used to deduce whether hypotheses about landscape evolution are likely to be valid, by making quantitative predictions about their development.

    </div>
    <p>
    LEMs are ultimately driven by a set of mathematical equations - the geomorphic transport functions, often termed 'laws' (Tucker and Hancock, 2010). These laws may be derived from physical first principles, empirical evidence, or sometimes a combination of both. When implemented in a model, these laws are applied to a series of discretised cells or nodes representing the landscape. <br/>
     A wide range of fluvial incision processes can be simulated with these models, including both detachment- and transport-limited erosion models, sediment transport, and a range of hydrological and rainfall-runoff generation routines. Recent development of modules has extended.
     <br/>
     Recent development of modules has extended process representation to include, for example, modules of dynamic vegetation growth, floodplain evolution, dynamic adjustment of channel width, representation of sediment grain size, and debris flows.

  <strong>Drainage reorganization at various scales</strong>
  <p>
  Continental-scale drainages host the world’s largest rivers and offshore sediment accumulations, many of which contain significant petroleum reserves. Rate of sediment supply in these settings may be a signal of external controls (e.g., tectonics, climate) on landscape evolution, yet deciphering between these controls remains a major challenge in interpreting the ancient stratigraphic record. <br/>
  In this module we will explore drainage reorganization at catchment, regional and continental scales, we will discuss the role of tectonics and climates on catchment dynamics, drainage networks responses and subsequent landscape evolution.

  <p>We will use <strong><a href="http://jupyter.org" target="_blank">Jupyter</a></strong>,  a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. To access the module materials we will download via Kitematic a  <strong><a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker" target="_blank">Docker</a></strong> container called <strong>todo</strong>. Please follow the documentation provided <strong><a href="{{ site.prefix }}/LabDeploy.html">here</a></strong> on how to install the materials on your local computer or directly from the school computer labs.<br/>
  </p>

  <strong>LAB 1: Role of climate change in drainage network reorganization</strong>
  <p>This lab is an upscaled version of an experimental model from <strong><a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&ved=0ahUKEwjy5Mj3tp_QAhVIJZQKHc69AkEQFgg9MAc&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgeomorphology.sese.asu.edu%2FPapers%2FBonnetAndCrave2003.pdf&usg=AFQjCNFX91CI_BHtHcJBj-5hshDJH0ZAvg&sig2=3kIXha9LklRYRlLimeARig" target="_blank">Bonnet & Crave 2003</a></strong>.   simulate mountain range formation by upscaling the analogue experiment presented in previous section. The <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ibm8I1GvT8" target="_blank">example</a></strong> illustrates long-term landscape evolution of an active mountain range. It shows how the constant valley spacing, achieved at steady state on both sides of the range, is progressively shifted due to a precipitation gradient applied across the mountain belt.<br/>
  You will apply different climatic conditions and perform morphometrics and hydrometrics analysis using <strong><a href="https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands/wiki">Badlands</a></strong> to quantitatively evaluate the catchment dynamics.</p>

  <strong>LAB 2: Role of climate change in drainage network reorganization</strong>
  <p>
  Using <strong><a href="https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands/wiki">Badlands</a></strong>, you will simulate the main processes responsible for the formation of the Grand Canyon. You will be able to modify the erosive power of the water flow, the hillslope coefficients and the climate/tectonic forces to see how different the Grand Canyon might have looked as it developed through different types of bedrock.<br/>
  You will analyse the development and propagation of <strong>knickpoints</strong> within the main valleys for different initial conditions of fault activity.
  </p>
  <strong>LAB 3: Role of flexural isostasy in foreland basin formation</strong>
  <p>
  <strong>Flexure of the lithosphere</strong> is a frequently observed process by which loads bend the elastic outer shell of Earth. Using <strong><a href="https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands/wiki">Badlands</a></strong>, you will simulate how variation in elastic thicknesses of the underlying plate is controlling basin formation and test the feedback mechanisms between surface processes, sedimentation and flexure with a set of simple models.<br/>
  It will give you some insights on large-scale geometry of the sedimentary infill as related to orogen tectonics evolution of foreland basins.
