Access to quality data is essential to understand marine processes. Over the last 20 years, **Ocean Data portals** have emerged and are routinely used by Scientific organizations, Research agencies and the Industry to better understand the _complexity of the Ocean_ and its _interactions with Climate and Life_. These portals facilitate seamless access to marine data/services and promote the exchange and dissemination of marine data and services.

Ocean scientists routinely perform data _crunching_ to understand a particular system and need to **access and query** extensive lists of data.
Understanding how these data are stored, their origin and how to quickly retreive particular information from them are what this module is all about!
