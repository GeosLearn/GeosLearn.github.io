Access to quality data is essential to understand marine processes. Over the last 20 years, **Ocean Data portals** have emerged and are routinely used by Scientific organizations, Research agencies and the Industry to better understand the _complexity of the Ocean_ and its _interactions with Climate and Life_. These portals facilitate seamless access to marine data/services and promote the exchange and dissemination of marine data and services.

Ocean scientists routinely perform data _crunching_ to understand a particular system and need to **access and query** extensive lists of data.
Understanding how these data are stored, their origin and how to quickly retrieve particular information from them are what this module is all about!

  <p>The information that is stored, processed, and exchanged, is at the heart of <strong>modern marine science</strong>. We will consider the Web's information systems that serve as entry points to information of all sorts. The most widespread examples of this kind of system are search engines like Google, which provides an index to billions of documents on the Web, and in a way allows us to think of the Web as a gigantic database. </p>

  <p>The Web's information systems, just like centralised data management systems, are mediators between individuals with little desire to trouble themselves with programming details, and physical objects like discs or USB keys. In this module, we will be looking at data systems that can <strong>manage information, understand it and make it available to marine scientists</strong>.</p>

  <p>Wave height measures taken every day by a buoy offshore Sydney are <strong>data</strong>. A graph showing the evolution of the significant wave height over time, at a given place, is <strong>information</strong>. The fact that the number of extreme storms hitting Australian's coast increases as a result of climate change is <strong>knowledge</strong>. These three notions are very closely linked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roughly speaking, here is how you should use them:
  <br/>
  - A piece of <strong>data</strong> provides a basic description, typically numerical for our purposes, of a given reality. <br/>
  - Drawing on the collected data, <strong>information</strong> is obtained by organising and structuring data so as to derive meaning.<br/>
  - By understanding the meaning of information, we obtain <strong>knowledge</strong>.<br/>
  <br/>
  One of the great challenges for Ocean Data users is to understand where and how to find technologies that make it possible to evaluate, validate, verify, and rank information to help them in their jobs. This involves understanding how the ocean data providers are organised, the main standards, vocabularies and formats which are used by the community as well as the best approach for accessing and querying these information routinely.</p>
