Sedimentary basins are regions where considerable thicknesses of sediments have accumulated. Sedimentary basins are widespread both onshore and offshore.
The way in which they form was a matter of considerable debate until the last 20 years. The advance in our understanding during this very short period is
mainly due to the efforts of the oil industry.

In this module, we will present some natural examples of basin formation and how they form. We will summarize the more important aspects of
intraslope basins evolution in the Gulf of Mexico. Both qualitative and quantitative aspects of basin analysis identifying flux rates, tectonic activity and
sedimentary geology will be addressed.
