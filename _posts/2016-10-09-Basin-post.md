Sedimentary basins are regions where considerable thicknesses of sediments have accumulated. Sedimentary basins are widespread both onshore and offshore.
The way in which they form was a matter of considerable debate until the last 20 years. The advance in our understanding during this very short period is
mainly due to the efforts of the oil industry.

In this module, we will present some natural examples of basin formation and how they form. We will summarize the more important aspects of
intraslope basins evolution in the Gulf of Mexico. Both qualitative and quantitative aspects of basin analysis identifying flux rates, tectonic activity and
sedimentary geology will be addressed.

  <p>Sedimentary basins capture Earth's sea level, climate history, and the variation of the surface topography due to geodynamic, tectonic, and surface processes. They host a range of conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon resources of critical importance for the continued functioning of modern society. We increasingly rely on the same basins for oil, gas, geothermal energy, and water, and managing these competing uses requires much greater sophistication. For both exploration and resource extraction, geologists need to constrain the structure, evolution, and state of sedimentary basins. This requires a good understanding of the processes that form, deform, and fill these basins (

  <strong>Sedimentary basin classification:</strong>
  <p>About 80% of the sedimentary basins on Earth have formed by extension of the plates (often termed lithospheric extension). Most of the remaining 20% of basins were formed by flexure of the plates beneath various forms of loading. Pull-apart or strike-slip basins are relatively small and form in association with bends in strike-slip faults, such as the San Andreas Fault or the North Anatolian Fault. Only a very small number of basins still defy explanation, although we suspect that at least some of these have a thermal origin.</p>

  <p>In this lecture, we will discuss this classification and present results of
  numerical models developed within the EarthByte Group showing the formation and
  evolution of several types of these sedimentary basins.

  <p>We will use <strong><a href="http://jupyter.org" target="_blank">Jupyter</a></strong>,  a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. To access the module materials we will download via Kitematic a  <strong><a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker" target="_blank">Docker</a></strong> container called <strong>globresources</strong>. Please follow the documentation provided <strong><a href="{{ site.prefix }}/LabDeploy.html">here</a></strong> on how to install the materials on your local computer or directly from the school computer labs.<br/>
