Sedimentary basins are regions where considerable thicknesses of sediments have accumulated. Sedimentary basins are widespread both onshore and offshore.
The way in which they form was a matter of considerable debate until the last 20 years. The advance in our understanding during this very short period is
mainly due to the efforts of the oil industry.

In this module, we will present some natural examples of basin formation and how they form. We will summarize the more important aspects of
intraslope basins evolution in the Gulf of Mexico. Both qualitative and quantitative aspects of basin analysis identifying flux rates, tectonic activity and
sedimentary geology will be addressed.

  <p>Sedimentary basins capture Earth's sea level, climate history, and the variation of the surface topography due to geodynamic, tectonic, and surface processes. They host a range of conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon resources of critical importance for the continued functioning of modern society. We increasingly rely on the same basins for oil, gas, geothermal energy, and water, and managing these competing uses requires much greater sophistication. For both exploration and resource extraction, geologists need to constrain the structure, evolution, and state of sedimentary basins. This requires a good understanding of the processes that form, deform, and fill these basins (source:

  <strong>Sedimentary basin classification:</strong>
  <p>About 80% of the sedimentary basins on Earth have formed by extension of the plates (often termed lithospheric extension). Most of the remaining 20% of basins were formed by flexure of the plates beneath various forms of loading. Pull-apart or strike-slip basins are relatively small and form in association with bends in strike-slip faults, such as the San Andreas Fault or the North Anatolian Fault. Only a very small number of basins still defy explanation, although we suspect that at least some of these have a thermal origin.</p>

  <p>In this lecture, we will discuss this classification and present results of
  numerical models developed within the EarthByte Group showing the formation and
  evolution of several types of these sedimentary basins.

  <strong>Gulf of Mexico intra-slope minibasins:</strong>
  <p>
   Salt has played an important role in petroleum exploration since the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindletop" target="_blank">Spindletop Dome</a></strong> discovery in Beaumont, Texas in 1906. Today, much of the prime interest in salt tectonics still derives from the petroleum industry because many of the world's largest hydrocarbon provinces reside in salt-related sedimentary basins (e.g. Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Campos Basin, Lower Congo Basin, Santos Basin and Zagros). An understanding of salt and how it influences tectonics and sedimentation is therefore critical to effective and efficient petroleum exploration
   (<strong><a href="http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/363/1/1.full" target="_blank">Archer et al. 2012</a></strong>) .

  In this second lecture, we will look at how basins containing salt evolve and deform through time. The addition of halokinetic processes to the geodynamic history of a basin can lead to a plethora of architectures and geometries. The rich variety of resultant morphologies have considerable economic as well as academic interest. To illustrate the interplay between salt tectonics and sedimentation, we will discuss the evolution of intra-slope minibasins in the Gulf of Mexico and present a simple model proposed by
  <strong><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276907156_Stratigraphic_evolution_of_intraslope_minibasins_Insights_from_surface-based_model" target="_blank">Sylvester et al. 2015</a></strong>  which helps in the understanding of how stratal termination patterns relate to variations in sediment input and basin subsidence.
